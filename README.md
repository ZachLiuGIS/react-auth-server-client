# React Authentication Demo Server/Client

This is a updated course project on authentication by Stephen Grider on udemy (Advanced React and Redux).

The course is excellent and well structured, the only thing is some packages are a little outdated, so I tried
the upgrade and a few small changes.

### The project depends on mongo db for store user data.

### What is different:

Some packages have gone through major API changes.

- React v16
- Redux v5
- bootstrap v4 for styling
- react router v4 (react-router-dom, dynamic routes)
- redux form v7 (Field replaced fields, used function for rendering)
